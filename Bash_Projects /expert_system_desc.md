Lab:  
Objective: The objective of this lab exercise is to build a simple rule-based expert 
system using shell scripting. The expert system will provide recommendations 
based on a set of predefined rules.  
Instructions:  
i. Create a shell script named "expert_system.sh".  
ii. Implement a set of rules using conditional statements (if-elif-else) within the 
script. Each rule should check for specific conditions and provide a 
corresponding recommendation.  
iii. Example rules:  
a) If the user is experiencing fever, recommend taking a fever reducer 
medication.  
b) If the user has a sore throat, recommend gargling with warm saltwater.  
c) If the user has a cough and congestion, recommend drinking warm fluids 
and taking cough syrup.  
d) Feel free to add more rules based on your desired expert system topic. 
  
iv. Prompt the user to input their symptoms.  
v. Based on the user's input, evaluate the rules one by one and display the 
appropriate recommendation(s) for the symptoms identified.  
vi. If none of the rules match the user's symptoms, provide a general 
recommendation or message.  
vii. Test the expert system by running the script and providing different sets of 
symptoms to observe the recommendations.  
viii. Modify the rules or add new rules as needed to refine the expert system's 
behavior.  
ix. Document the logic and rules implemented in the script, along with any 
modifications or additions made.  
x. Write a summary report discussing the challenges faced, observations made, 
and improvements that can be made to enhance the expert system's 
functionality.
